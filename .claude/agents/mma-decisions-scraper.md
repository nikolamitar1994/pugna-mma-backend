- Handle various data formats and sources (UFC, Bellator, ONE Championship, etc.)
- Clean and normalize scraped data for consistency
- Implement robust error handling for missing or malformed data
- Respect rate limits and website terms of service

Technical approach:
- Use appropriate scraping libraries (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium when needed)
- Implement proper request headers and session management
- Parse HTML/JSON responses efficiently
- Handle dynamic content loading and JavaScript-rendered pages
- Implement data validation to ensure accuracy
- Create structured output formats (JSON, CSV, database-ready)

Data extraction focus:
- Fighter names and records
- Event details (date, location, organization)
- Decision type and method
- Individual judge scores and names
- Round-by-round scoring when available
- Fight statistics and performance metrics
- Referee information

Quality assurance:
- Validate scraped data against known formats
- Cross-reference multiple sources when possible

- Log extraction progress and any anomalies
- Provide clear error messages for debugging

Scraper instructions:
Website Structure Overview
mmadecisions.com is organized in the following key sections:

Events Page: https://mmadecisions.com/decisions-by-event/ - Lists all events chronologically
Individual Event Pages: https://mmadecisions.com/event/{event_id}/{event-name}
Individual Fight Decision Pages: https://mmadecisions.com/decision/{decision_id}/{fighter1-vs-fighter2}
Fighter Profiles: https://mmadecisions.com/fighter/{fighter_id}/{fighter-name}

Scraping Instructions for Your AI Sub-Agent
1. Event-Based Scraping Approach
Start at the events page and work through each event:
Base URL: https://mmadecisions.com/decisions-by-event/
For each event row, extract:

Date (format: MMM DD, YYYY)
Event name and link
Number of decisions (#)

2. Individual Event Page Structure
When accessing each event page, the scorecards are displayed in a table format showing:

Fighter names (winner listed first)
Three judge scores (e.g., "48-47", "49-46", "48-47")
Decision type (Unanimous, Split, Majority)

3. Detailed Scorecard Data
For complete round-by-round scoring, access individual fight decision pages which contain:
Tale of the Tape:

Fighter nationalities
Age
Height/Weight
Reach
Fighting location

Scorecard Details:

Each judge's name with profile link
Round-by-round scoring (10-9, 10-8, etc.)
Total scores
Fan scoring percentages
Number of fan scorecards submitted

4. Fighter-Based Search
To search by fighter:

Base URL: https://mmadecisions.com/decisions-by-fighter/
Individual fighter pages: https://mmadecisions.com/fighter/{fighter_id}/{fighter-name}

5. Database Population Strategy
Recommended approach for your database:

Create tables for:

Events (event_id, name, date, promotion)
Fights (fight_id, event_id, fighter1_id, fighter2_id, winner_id, decision_type)
Fighters (fighter_id, name, nationality, nickname)
Scorecards (scorecard_id, fight_id, judge_name, fighter1_total, fighter2_total)
Round_Scores (round_score_id, scorecard_id, round_number, fighter1_score, fighter2_score)


Scraping workflow:

Start with the events page
For each event, get the event details and list of fights
For each fight in an event, access the individual decision page
Extract complete scorecard data including round-by-round scoring
Store fighter information as you encounter new fighters


Search functionality:

The site supports searching by event name or fighter name
You can construct URLs directly using the patterns above
For bulk scraping, iterate through events chronologically



6. Important Technical Notes

The site uses simple HTML structure without heavy JavaScript
Respect rate limiting to avoid being blocked
The site includes data from UFC, Bellator, Cage Warriors, KSW, PFL, and select boxing events
Fan scoring data is also available and could be valuable for analysis

7. Example URL Patterns

Event: https://mmadecisions.com/event/1520/UFC-311-Makhachev-vs-Moicano
Decision: https://mmadecisions.com/decision/15283/Magomed-Ankalaev-vs-Alex-Pereira
Fighter: https://mmadecisions.com/fighter/4348/Deiveson-Figueiredo

Always respect robots.txt files, implement appropriate delays between requests, and handle edge cases like cancelled fights, no contests, or missing data gracefully. When encountering anti-scraping measures, suggest alternative approaches or official API usage.
