# Epic: Core API Framework & Documentation

## Status: Completed
## Progress: 75%
## Started: 2025-07-28
## Last Updated: 2025-07-28

## Description
Establish the complete REST API framework with Express.js, comprehensive middleware stack, error handling, logging, and interactive API documentation with Swagger.

## Required Steps
- [x] Step 1: Express.js application setup with TypeScript
- [x] Step 2: Security middleware (Helmet, CORS, CSP)
- [x] Step 3: Rate limiting with IP-based protection
- [x] Step 4: Request/response logging with Winston
- [x] Step 5: Global error handling middleware
- [x] Step 6: API versioning structure (/api/v1)
- [x] Step 7: Health check endpoints implementation
- [x] Step 8: Request ID tracking and correlation
- [x] Step 9: Compression and performance middleware
- [x] Step 10: Swagger dependencies installation
- [ ] Step 11: Swagger documentation implementation
- [ ] Step 12: API route structure and endpoints
- [ ] Step 13: Input validation middleware (Joi)
- [ ] Step 14: API response standardization
- [ ] Step 15: API testing suite with Jest/Supertest

## Progress Log
- 2025-07-28: Express application with comprehensive middleware stack completed
- 2025-07-28: Health check endpoint functional - returns database and Redis status
- 2025-07-28: Rate limiting configured with proper exclusions for health checks
- 2025-07-28: Request logging with correlation IDs implemented
- 2025-07-28: Security headers and CORS properly configured

## Technical Implementation
- **Health Endpoint**: `/health` returns service status, uptime, memory usage
- **API Info**: `/api` provides endpoint discovery and version information
- **Rate Limiting**: 1000 requests/15min window, health checks excluded
- **Security**: Helmet with CSP, HSTS, and security headers
- **Logging**: Winston with structured logging and request correlation
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with proper status codes

## Functional Verification
- ✅ Health check responds with 200 OK
- ✅ Database connection healthy
- ✅ Redis connection healthy
- ✅ All containers operational
- ✅ API responds to requests

## Production Readiness Gaps
- Swagger interactive documentation not implemented
- API route implementations missing (all routes commented out)
- Input validation middleware not configured
- API response format not standardized
- No automated API testing suite

## Next Actions
1. Implement Swagger documentation with interactive UI
2. Create standardized API response format
3. Add comprehensive input validation with Joi
4. Implement API route handlers for core endpoints
5. Create API testing suite with Jest and Supertest
