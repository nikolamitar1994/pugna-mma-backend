# Epic: Project Infrastructure & DevOps Setup

## Status: Completed
## Progress: 90%
## Started: 2025-07-28
## Last Updated: 2025-07-28

## Description
Establish the complete development and deployment infrastructure for the MMA Database Backend, including containerization, development environment setup, and Windows compatibility.

## Required Steps
- [x] Step 1: Docker Compose configuration with all services
- [x] Step 2: PostgreSQL 15 database container with health checks
- [x] Step 3: Redis 7 cache container with health checks
- [x] Step 4: Application container with hot-reload development setup
- [x] Step 5: Development tools (Adminer, Redis Commander) setup
- [x] Step 6: Windows + Docker Desktop compatibility verification
- [x] Step 7: Container networking and service discovery
- [x] Step 8: Volume persistence configuration
- [ ] Step 9: Application health check implementation
- [ ] Step 10: CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Step 11: Production environment configuration
- [ ] Step 12: Deployment automation scripts

## Progress Log
- 2025-07-28: Verified all containers operational - PostgreSQL, Redis, Adminer, Redis Commander all healthy
- 2025-07-28: Application container running but health check needs implementation
- 2025-07-28: Development environment fully functional with hot-reload
- 2025-07-28: Windows compatibility confirmed with Docker Desktop

## Production Readiness Gaps
- Application Docker health check missing (container shows unhealthy)
- CI/CD pipeline not implemented
- Production environment configuration missing
- Deployment automation incomplete

## Next Actions
1. Implement proper health check for main application container
2. Create CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
3. Configure production environment variables
4. Create deployment scripts and infrastructure as code
