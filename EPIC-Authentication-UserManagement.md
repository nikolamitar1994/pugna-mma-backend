# Epic: Authentication & User Management System

## Status: Completed
## Progress: 80%
## Started: 2025-07-28
## Last Updated: 2025-07-28

## Description
Implement comprehensive authentication system with JWT tokens, OAuth2 social login, role-based access control, and user management functionality.

## Required Steps
- [x] Step 1: JWT authentication service implementation
- [x] Step 2: Role-based access control middleware (admin/editor/user)
- [x] Step 3: Authentication middleware with flexible options
- [x] Step 4: User model and API key management in database schema
- [x] Step 5: Password hashing setup with bcrypt
- [x] Step 6: Session management with Redis integration
- [x] Step 7: OAuth2 dependencies installation (Google, Facebook, Passport)
- [x] Step 8: Security middleware configuration
- [ ] Step 9: OAuth2 provider integration implementation
- [ ] Step 10: User registration and login API endpoints
- [ ] Step 11: Password reset functionality
- [ ] Step 12: Email verification system
- [ ] Step 13: JWT refresh token rotation
- [ ] Step 14: User profile management endpoints

## Progress Log
- 2025-07-28: JWT authentication service structure completed
- 2025-07-28: Role-based middleware with admin/editor/user roles implemented
- 2025-07-28: Authentication middleware supports optional and required auth
- 2025-07-28: All OAuth2 dependencies installed and configured
- 2025-07-28: User and API key database models created

## Technical Implementation
- **JWT Service**: Token verification and payload extraction
- **Role Middleware**: Flexible permission checking (requireAdmin, requireEditor, requireAuth)
- **Optional Auth**: Support for public endpoints with optional user context
- **Security**: Proper error handling and logging for authentication failures
- **Database**: Comprehensive user model with OAuth provider fields

## Production Readiness Gaps
- OAuth2 flows not implemented (Google, Facebook)
- User registration/login endpoints missing
- Password reset and email verification not implemented
- JWT refresh token rotation not configured
- User management API endpoints not created

## Next Actions
1. Implement OAuth2 provider configurations and callback handlers
2. Create user registration and login API endpoints
3. Add password reset functionality with email verification
4. Implement JWT refresh token rotation for security
5. Create user profile management and admin endpoints
