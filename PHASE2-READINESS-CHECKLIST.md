#### 3. Create Initial Sample Data (4 hours) - **CRITICAL FOR DEVELOPMENT**
- [ ] Create seed data for organizations (UFC, KSW, Oktagon, PFL)
- [ ] Add sample weight classes for each organization
- [ ] Create 5-10 sample fighters for testing
- [ ] Add 2-3 sample events with fights
- [ ] Load seed data into database

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks:
1. **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance during development
2. **API Consistency**: Establish response patterns early
3. **Data Integrity**: Implement proper validation at all levels

### Timeline Risks:
1. **Epic Dependencies**: Complete Epic 5 before starting Epic 6
2. **Sample Data**: Ensure adequate test data throughout development
3. **Documentation Lag**: Document APIs as they're built

### Quality Risks:
1. **Testing**: Add tests for each feature as it's implemented
2. **Code Review**: Establish review process for Phase 2 work
3. **Performance**: Monitor response times and optimize early
