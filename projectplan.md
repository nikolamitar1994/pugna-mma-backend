# MMA Database Backend Project Plan

## Project Overview

### Core Purpose and Vision
A comprehensive MMA database backend service that aggregates historical fight data from multiple sources and provides a robust REST API for frontend applications to display fighter profiles, fight statistics, event information, divisional rankings, editorial content, and real-time upcoming event tracking with multi-language support.

### Vision Statement
Become the go-to MMA data and content platform for developers and fans globally, providing reliable, comprehensive, and engaging access to historical and current MMA data across all major organizations in multiple languages with proper fighter identification and search capabilities.

## Target Users

### Primary Users: MMA Application Developers
- **Need**: Affordable, reliable API with comprehensive historical data, content, multi-language support, and proper fighter name handling
- **Goal**: Build MMA applications for global audiences without worrying about data collection, translation, or fighter identification issues

### Secondary Users: MMA Media and Content Creators
- **Need**: Quick access to fighter statistics, historical fight data, storylines, international content, and accurate fighter search
- **Goal**: Create data-driven content efficiently for diverse audiences with accurate fighter information

### Tertiary Users: International MMA Fans
- **Need**: Access to MMA data and content in their native language with culturally appropriate name formatting
- **Goal**: Follow MMA events and fighters without language barriers

### Quaternary Users: Internal Admin Users
- **Need**: Intuitive interface for data management, content publishing, translation workflow, and fighter name standardization
- **Goal**: Maintain data accuracy, handle edge cases, publish engaging content, manage translations, and ensure fighter uniqueness

## Key Differentiators

- **Multi-organization support** (UFC, KSW, Oktagon, PFL) from launch - most APIs only cover UFC
- **Wikipedia-first approach** for data consistency instead of fragmented sources
- **AI-powered completion** for missing fighter data
- **Comprehensive historical data** with complete fighter career records
- **Rich editorial content system** (news, blogs, videos) with fight storylines
- **Real-time upcoming event tracking** with automatic cancellation detection
- **Full multi-language support** for global accessibility
- **Structured fighter name handling** (first/last name separation) instead of single string fields
- **Affordable pricing** targeting independent developers who can't afford expensive commercial APIs

## Technology Stack

### Backend Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js or Fastify
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and consistency
- **Architecture**: Modular monolith with microservices potential
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data (fighters, events, matches)
