# Epic: Core Backend Architecture & Database Design

## Status: Completed
## Progress: 85%
## Started: 2025-07-28
## Last Updated: 2025-07-28

## Description
Design and implement the comprehensive database schema and backend architecture for the MMA Database, including all data models, relationships, and database optimization features.

## Required Steps
- [x] Step 1: PostgreSQL database schema design (404+ lines)
- [x] Step 2: Core data entities (Fighters, Events, Fights, Organizations)
- [x] Step 3: Fighter name management with structured fields
- [x] Step 4: Content management system tables
- [x] Step 5: User authentication and API key management
- [x] Step 6: Comprehensive indexing strategy
- [x] Step 7: Database connection pooling implementation
- [x] Step 8: Transaction support and error handling
- [x] Step 9: Automated timestamp triggers
- [x] Step 10: Redis configuration and health checks
- [ ] Step 11: Database schema application to running instance
- [ ] Step 12: Database migration system implementation
- [ ] Step 13: Seed data creation and loading
- [ ] Step 14: Database backup and recovery procedures

## Progress Log
- 2025-07-28: Comprehensive database schema completed with 20+ tables
- 2025-07-28: All MMA domain entities properly modeled with relationships
- 2025-07-28: Database connection pooling implemented with singleton pattern
- 2025-07-28: Redis integration completed with health monitoring
- 2025-07-28: Transaction support and error handling implemented

## Technical Highlights
- UUID-based primary keys throughout
- Comprehensive fighter name management (structured first/last names)
- Multi-organization support (UFC, KSW, Oktagon, PFL)
- Full-text search capabilities with GIN indexes
- JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- Proper foreign key relationships and constraints

## Production Readiness Gaps
- Database schema not applied to running database instance
- Migration system exists in structure but not executed
- No seed data for testing and development
- Missing database performance monitoring tools

## Next Actions
1. Apply schema.sql to running PostgreSQL instance
2. Create and load initial seed data
3. Implement database migration execution
4. Add database performance monitoring
