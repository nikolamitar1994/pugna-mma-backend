## Django Migration Critical Path Analysis 

### 🚨 Critical Migration Path (Sequential)
1. **EPIC-00** (Migration) → **EPIC-01** (Django Infrastructure) → **EPIC-02** (Django Models) → **EPIC-03** (Django Auth) → **EPIC-04** (DRF)
2. **EPIC-05** (Django Fighters) → **EPIC-06** (Django Events) → **EPIC-07** (Django Fights) → **EPIC-08** (Django Rankings)

### ⚡ Django Advantages for Parallel Development
- **EPIC-09** (Content): Django admin eliminates custom development
- **EPIC-13** (Admin Dashboard): **FREE** with Django - no development needed
- **Multiple EPICs** can leverage Django's built-in functionality simultaneously

## Current Status & Next Actions

### ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETED - READY FOR PHASE 2
1. **✅ Django Migration Complete**: EPIC-00 through EPIC-04 (completed)
2. **✅ Core Features Complete**: EPIC-05, 06, 07, 08 all completed (100% of Phase 1)
3. **🚀 Next Phase**: Begin EPIC-09 Django Content Management System

### 📅 Current Sprint Focus (Week of 2025-07-29)
- **✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETED**: Django Migration + All Core Features (EPIC-00 through EPIC-08)
- **✅ EPIC-09 COMPLETED**: Django Content Management with Editorial Workflow
- **🚀 PHASE 2 ACTIVE**: Ready to begin EPIC-10 Advanced Media Management
- **📋 Priority**: Complete Phase 2 advanced content features (EPICs 10-14)

### ✅ Django Migration Benefits (Technical Debt Eliminated)
- ✅ Database schema preserved (no migration needed)
- ✅ API documentation automatic via DRF Spectacular
- ✅ Authentication system complete with Django built-ins
- ✅ Admin interface FREE with Django (eliminates EPIC-13 entirely)

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team Allocation
- **Backend Developer**: 100% allocation (critical path EPICs)
- **Frontend/API Developer**: Available for EPIC-09/10 parallel work
- **DevOps**: 20% allocation for monitoring and deployment
