- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery with caching and optimization
- **Media Analytics**: Track media usage, performance, and engagement
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient handling of large media collections

### Business Value
- **Performance**: Optimized media delivery improves user experience
- **Storage Efficiency**: Smart compression and format selection reduces costs
- **Global Reach**: CDN integration provides fast media loading worldwide
- **Editorial Efficiency**: Advanced media tools speed up content creation
- **Analytics Insights**: Media performance data drives content strategy

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Models Design

```python
# MediaAsset Model - Central media entity
class MediaAsset:
    - title, description, alt_text
    - file_type (image, video, audio, document)
    - original_file, file_size, mime_type
    - width, height, duration (for videos)
    - upload_date, uploader (User)
    - is_public, is_optimized
    - storage_backend (local, s3, cloudinary)
    - cdn_url, original_url
    - metadata (JSONB for EXIF, video info, etc.)
    - usage_count, view_count
    - tags, categories

# MediaVariant Model - Different sizes/formats
class MediaVariant:
    - media_asset (FK)
    - variant_type (thumbnail, medium, large, webp, etc.)
    - file, file_size
    - width, height, quality
    - format (jpg, webp, mp4, etc.)
    - cdn_url, is_optimized

# MediaCollection Model - Organized media groups
class MediaCollection:
    - name, description, slug
    - type (gallery, event_photos, fighter_media)
    - is_public, created_by (User)
    - cover_image (FK to MediaAsset)
    - assets (M2M to MediaAsset)

# MediaUsage Model - Track where media is used
class MediaUsage:
    - media_asset (FK)
    - content_type, object_id (Generic FK)
    - usage_type (featured_image, inline, gallery)
    - created_at, last_used

# VideoProcessingJob Model - Async video processing
class VideoProcessingJob:
    - media_asset (FK)
    - status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
    - job_id, processing_backend
    - progress_percent, error_message
    - started_at, completed_at
```

### Integration Strategy
- **Storage Backends**: Local, AWS S3, Cloudinary integration
- **Processing Queue**: Celery tasks for image/video optimization
- **CDN Integration**: CloudFront, Cloudinary, or similar CDN services
- **Search Integration**: Full-text search across media metadata
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for media management
