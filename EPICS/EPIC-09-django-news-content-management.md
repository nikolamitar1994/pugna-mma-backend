## üìñ Overview

Build a comprehensive content management system for MMA news, articles, and editorial content that seamlessly integrates with our existing fighter, event, and organization data. This system will provide content creators with a powerful Django admin interface and deliver content through REST APIs.

## üéØ Objectives

### Primary Goals

- **Content-Data Integration**: Link articles to fighters, events, organizations, and rankings
- **Editorial Workflow**: Draft ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Publish workflow with proper permissions
- **Performance**: Fast content delivery with caching and optimization

### Business Value
- **Traffic Generation**: SEO-optimized content drives organic search traffic
- **User Engagement**: Rich content keeps users on platform longer
- **Revenue Opportunities**: Content platform enables advertising and sponsored content
- **Brand Authority**: Editorial content establishes platform as MMA authority

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Models Design

```python
# Article Model - Central content entity
class Article:
    - title, slug, content (rich text)
    - excerpt, featured_image
    - author (User), status (draft/review/published/archived)
    - meta_title, meta_description (SEO)
    - published_at, created_at, updated_at
    - view_count, is_featured

# Category Model - Hierarchical content organization
class Category:
    - name, slug, description
    - parent (self-referential for hierarchy)
    - is_active, order

# Tag Model - Flexible content tagging
class Tag:
    - name, slug
    - color (for UI differentiation)

# Relationship Models - Link content to entities
class ArticleFighter:
    - article, fighter
    - relationship_type (about, mentions, features)

class ArticleEvent:
    - article, event  
    - relationship_type (preview, recap, analysis)

class ArticleOrganization:
    - article, organization
    - relationship_type (news, announcement, analysis)
```
