# EPIC-01: Django Infrastructure & DevOps Setup

## Status: ðŸ”„ REQUIRES MIGRATION
**Phase**: 0 - Migration Foundation  
**Priority**: Critical (Migration Dependency)  
**Estimated Time**: 1 week (Django migration)  
**Actual Node.js Time**: 1 week (completed)  

## Overview
Migrate from Node.js infrastructure to Django-based development environment including updated Docker containers, Django project setup, and production-ready infrastructure configuration.

## Business Value
- Enables team development with Django consistent environment
- Leverages Django admin panel (30% development time saved)
- Provides production-ready Django infrastructure from day one
- Establishes deployment automation and monitoring for Django stack

## User Stories

### US-01: As a Developer, I want a containerized Django development environment
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Docker containers for Django, PostgreSQL, Redis running
- [ ] Hot reload for Python/Django development
- [ ] Database accessible via pgAdmin 4 and Adminer
- [ ] All services healthy and communicating
- [ ] Django admin panel accessible at /admin/

### US-02: As a DevOps Engineer, I want Django CI/CD pipeline ready
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow configured for Django
- [ ] Automated Django testing on push/PR
- [ ] Docker build and deployment for Django app
- [ ] Environment variable management for Django settings

### US-03: As a Windows Developer, I want native Django development setup
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Docker Desktop integration working with Django
- [ ] PostgreSQL accessible without conflicts (port 5433)
- [ ] Redis accessible for Django caching and sessions
- [ ] Development tools (pgAdmin 4) properly configured
- [ ] Django development server accessible with hot reload

## Technical Implementation

### Migration Required Tasks
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration with Django 5.0+, PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7
- [ ] Django project configuration with proper settings structure
- [ ] Django code quality setup (Black, isort, flake8)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for Django
- [ ] Environment variable validation with Django settings
- [ ] Health check endpoints for Django application
- [ ] Windows development compatibility maintained

### Database Configuration (Preserved)
- âœ… PostgreSQL 15 on port 5433 (avoiding Windows conflicts)
- âœ… Redis 7 for caching and session storage
- [ ] Django database connection configuration
- [ ] Django ORM health monitoring
- âœ… Database schema already exists (preserved from Node.js version)

### Security Setup
- [ ] Docker user security (non-root Django user)
- âœ… Environment variable isolation (preserved)
- âœ… Service network isolation (preserved)
- [ ] Django secrets management and security middleware

## Dependencies
**Depends on**: EPIC-00 (Node.js to Django Migration)  
**Blocks**: All Django-based epics require this infrastructure

## Definition of Done (Django Migration)
- [ ] All Docker containers running and healthy with Django
- [ ] Database accessible from Windows development tools (preserved)
- [ ] Hot reload working for Django development
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional for Django testing and deployment
- [ ] Documentation updated for Django setup process
- [ ] Team can clone repo and run `python manage.py runserver` successfully
- [ ] Django admin panel accessible and functional

## Migration Benefits Realized
- Django admin panel replaces 30% of custom admin development
- Better ORM for complex fighter name queries
- Superior Python web scraping ecosystem
- Faster development timeline (3 months vs 6 months)

## Next Epic
After Django migration complete, proceed to **EPIC-02: Django Models & Database Integration**
