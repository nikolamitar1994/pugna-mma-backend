# EPIC-05: Django Fighter Profile Management

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED (Django Migration Benefits)
**Phase**: 1 - Django Core Features  
**Priority**: Critical Path (Django Admin = 30% Time Saved)  
**Estimated Time**: 3 days (down from 1.5 weeks due to Django admin)  
**Dependencies**: Django Migration Complete (EPIC-00, EPIC-01, EPIC-02, EPIC-03, EPIC-04)  

## Overview
Implement Django-based fighter profile management leveraging Django admin panel, model serializers, and built-in search capabilities. The Django admin interface eliminates 30% of custom development time while providing superior structured name handling through Django ORM.

## Business Value

```

## Django Model Requirements

### Django Fighter Model (Migration Required)
- Django CharField fields: `first_name`, `last_name` 
- Python @property for computed `full_name`
- Django IntegerField for career statistics: wins, losses, draws
- Django DecimalField for physical attributes: height, weight, reach
- Django JSONField for flexible statistics and metadata
- Django Meta indexes for search performance

### Required Indexes
```sql
-- Full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_fighters_fulltext ON fighters 
USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', first_name || ' ' || last_name || ' ' || COALESCE(nickname, '')));

-- Name searches
CREATE INDEX idx_fighters_first_name ON fighters (first_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_fighters_last_name ON fighters (last_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_fighters_full_name ON fighters (full_name);

-- Trigram for fuzzy matching
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX idx_fighters_name_trgm ON fighters 
USING GIN (first_name gin_trgm_ops, last_name gin_trgm_ops);
```

## Integration Points

### Wikipedia Service Integration
- [ ] Service wrapper for Wikipedia API calls
