### Starting Celery Workers
```bash
# Start worker for all queues
celery -A mma_backend worker -l info

# Start specific queue workers
celery -A mma_backend worker -Q scraping -l info
celery -A mma_backend worker -Q calculations -l info

# Start beat scheduler for periodic tasks
celery -A mma_backend beat -l info
```

### API Usage Examples

#### Get Fighter Profile
```http
